                        Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time. In general
                        definitions of music will include common elements such as pitch (which governs melody and
                        harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics
                        (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes
                        termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize,
                        de-emphasize or omit some of these elements.

                    <p>Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to
                        rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without
                        instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives
                        from Greek μουσική (mousike; "art of the Muses").
                    </p>
                    <p>In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form or cultural activity
                        include the creation of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of
                        music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek
                        and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically
                        as harmonies. Common sayings such as "the harmony of the spheres" and "it is music to my ears"
                        point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century
                        composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, "There is no noise,
                        only sound."</p>
